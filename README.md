# Sails.js Documentation (v0.10.x Angular!)


Guide and reference documentation for the 0.10.x release of Sails.  Content for the documentation on the Sails website (sailsjs.org) is deployed from here.  The markdown files are split, relinked, converted to HTML, and formatted to fit within the skin of sailsjs.org.


##### Contributing to the docs
> We welcome your help!  Please send a pull request to this branch with corrections/additions and they'll be double-checked and merged as soon as possible.

##### How often are docs updated?
> When a patch release is released to npm, these docs will be redeployed to http://sailsjs.com/#!documentation


### New docs are coming!

We're currently working on a complete rewrite of the reference documentation.

# What is Sails?
Sails makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development.  It's especially good for building APIs, single page apps/sites, and realtime features like chat.

# Installation

To install the latest stable release:
```
npm install sails
```

Or to install globally with the command line tool: ```sudo npm install -g sails```

# Creating a New Sails Project

The global install of Sails comes bundled with a command-line tool which allows you to generate a new app as shown below:

```bash

    # Create the app
    sails foo
    cd foo

    # Install dependencies
    npm install -d

    # Fire up the server
    node app.js			
```

# Automatic JSON API: Better Than Scaffolding
HTML scaffolds just don't make sense for modern web apps.  Instead, Sails automatically builds a RESTful JSON API for your models.  Best of all, it supports HTTP _and_ WebSockets!

# Logo Usage Policy
The [Sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails), [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline), and [Skipper](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper) logos and artwork are the property of Mike McNeil. They are meant to be symbols of their respective projects, and represent the quality that the [core team](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails#team) works hard to ensure. We make these logos available to the Sails community to spread the word about the technology they're using, but do not give permission to use the logos in ways that would mislead and/or cause people to confuse other software with the original projects.


##### DO use the Sails/Waterline/Skipper logo and/or artwork:

+ To showcase a project built on Sails
+ To promote your Sails meetup/talk
+ In your blog post/tutorial
+ To cut shapes out of cookie dough

##### DON'T use the Sails/Waterline/Skipper logo and/or artwork:

+ To masquerade as an official representative of Sails, Waterline, or Skipper
+ As your profile image, header image, etc. on GitHub, npm, Twitter, Facebook, or any other platform
+ To promote a competing project/fork
+ In any other way that is misleading or abusive to the project, its users, or its maintainers.

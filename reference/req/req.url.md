# req.url

<!--
The querystring parser in Express/Connect removes the query string from the standard `req.url` in Node, so in Sails/Express/Koa/Connect, `req.url` is effectively a synonym for `req.path`.  Please see `req.path` for example usage.
-->

Like [`req.path`](), but includes the query string suffix, e.g. `/search?q=worlds%20largest%20dogs`.

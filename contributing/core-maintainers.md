# Core Maintainers

The Sails.js core maintainers are a small team of individuals located in Austin, TX who are passionate about making it easier for everyone to develop scalable, secure, custom web applications.  We fell in love with Node.js at first sight and are firm believers in the continued, unprecedented dominance of JavaScript as a unifying force for good.  We see Node.js as the logical continuation of the web standards movement into the world of server-side development.

The Sails core team maintains the framework and its related sub-projects, including the Waterline ORM, the Node-Machine project, the Skipper body parser, and all officially-supported generators, adapters, and hooks.  We rely heavily on the help of a network of contributors and users all over the world, but make all final decisions about our releases and roadmap.


#### History

Sails.js was originally developed by [Mike McNeil](http://twitter.com/mikermcneil) with the help of his company [Balderdash](http://balderdash.co), a small development and design studio in Austin, TX.  The first stable version of Sails was released in 2012.  Today, it is still actively maintained by the same core team ([@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil), [@particlebanana](https://github.com/particlebanana), [@sgress454](https://github.com/sgress454), [@irlnathan](https://github.com/irlnathan), and [@rachaelshaw](https://github.com/rachaelshaw)), along with the support of many amazing [contributors](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/network/members).


#### Financial Support

Today, Sails.js is financially supported by [Treeline](http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/11/treeline-wants-to-take-the-coding-out-of-building-a-backend/) (YC W15), a code automation platform built on Sails founded by the Sails.js core team in 2015.

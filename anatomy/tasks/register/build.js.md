# tasks/register/build.js

This Grunt tasklist will be executed if you run `sails www` or `grunt build` in a development environment.  It generates a folder containing your compiled assets, e.g. for troubleshooting issues with other Grunt plugins, bundling assets for an Electron or PhoneGap app, or deploying your app's flat files to a CDN.

# config/routes.js

This file contains custom routes.  Sails uses these routes to determine what to do each time it receives a request.

If Sails receives a URL that doesn't match any of the [custom routes](http://sailsjs.com/docs/concepts/routes/custom-routes) in this file, it will check for matching [assets](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/assets) (images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.). Finally, if those don't match either, the [default 404 handler](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/response-res/res-not-found) is triggered.

When you first generate your Sails app, there is only one route in this file.  Its job is to serve the home page.

You'll probably want to add some more.

# api/helpers/

This is the directory that holds your helpers.  In Sails, helpers are shared utilities that can be called from anywhere in your app.

When you call `sails generate helper tickle` via the command line from inside your project's root directory, Sails will generate the file `myApp/api/helpers/tickle.js`, with a skeleton helper file to get you started.

See the [main helpers documentation](http://sailsjs.com/docmentation/concepts/helpers) for more info.

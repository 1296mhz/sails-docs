# api/

This folder contains the vast majority of your app's back-end logic.  It is home to the 'M' and 'C' in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">MVC Framework</a>.

In it you will find the following:

- Controllers: Controllers contain most of the back-end logic for your app.
- Helpers: Helpers are shared utilities that can be called from anywhere in your app.
- Models: Models are the structures that contain data for your Sails App.
- Policies: Policies are typically used to authenticate clients and restrict access to certain parts of your app.

You may also find these folders, which are not generated by default in new Sails apps:

- Responses: Server response logic (see the [custom responses docs](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/custom-responses) for more info).
- Services: Services are shared utilities typically created in Sails apps before version 1.0.  In Sails 1.0 apps, it's recommended that you use _helpers_ instead.

# api/models/User.js

This file is created by running `sails generate model user` or `sails generate api user` (which will generate a [User controller](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/anatomy/api/controllers/UserController.js) as well).

In this file you will specify what attributes each model instance (record) should have.  You can also add custom model class methods, as well as override the global settings for things like `datastore`.

One of the best parts about Sails is that it uses [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline).  This means you can start developing your data models long before you commit to a particular database.

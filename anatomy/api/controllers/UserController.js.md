# api/controllers/UserController.js

This file is created by running `sails generate controller user` or `sails generate api user` (which will generate a [User model](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/anatomy/api/models/user.js) as well).

This is where you will put &ldquo;controller actions&rdquo; that send data to your clients and render the views which display that data.

Typically you will route requests to URLs that begin with `/user/` to actions in the User controller, either manually in your [`config/routes.js`](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/anatomy/config/routes.js) file, or by relying on [blueprint routes](http://next.sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/blueprints/blueprint-routes).

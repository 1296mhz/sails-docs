# Upgrading to v1.0

### Note:
> Sails version 1.0 has not officially been released and is currently in beta. Installing the beta is is a great way to try out the coming release get a head start on upgrading. However, the beta is not intended for use in production applications: instead, we recommend using the [latest stable version of Sails from NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sails) in production.

### Installing the 1.0 beta

To install the beta globally, run `npm install sails@beta -g`. To install the beta for a particular Sails app, `cd` into that app's directory, then run `npm install sails@beta --save`.

### Migration guide

For more detailed information about upgrading your Sails app to 1.0, see the [upgrade guide on the beta site](http://next.sailsjs.com/documentation/upgrading/to-v-1-0).

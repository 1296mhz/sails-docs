# Upgrading to v1.0

### Note:
> Sails version 1.0 has not officially been released, but a beta version is available for those who want to try out new features or get a head start on the upgrade process. Please note that this version is not intended for use in production applications; we recommend Sails apps use the [latest stable version from NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sails) until v1.0 has been formally released.

### Installing the 1.0 preview

To install the beta globally, run `npm install sails@beta -g`. To install it for a particular Sails app, `cd` into that app's directory, then run `npm install sails@beta --save`.

### Migration guide

For more detailed information about upgrading your Sails app to v1.0, see the [upgrade guide in the 1.0 docs](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/1.0/upgrading/To1.0.md). Just be aware that this migration guide is a work-in-progress, and may have some gaps in information as we continue updating the docs in the coming weeks.

### Questions?
If you have specific questions or concerns about how the v1.0 release will affect your app, just [send us a note](http://sailsjs.com/contact).

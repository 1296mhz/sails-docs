# Upgrading to v1.0

### Note:
> Sails version 1.0 has not officially been released, but is available for preview for those who want to try out the coming release or get a head start on upgrading. Please note that this version is not intended for use in production applications: instead, we recommend production Sails apps use the [latest stable version from NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sails) until v1.0 has been formally released.

### Installing the 1.0 preview

To install the preview globally, run `npm install sails@edge -g`. To install it for a particular Sails app, `cd` into that app's directory, then run `npm install sails@edge --save`.

### Migration guide

For more detailed information about upgrading your Sails app to v1.0, see the [upgrade guide in the 1.0 docs](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/1.0/upgrading/To1.0.md). Just be aware that this migration guide is a work-in-progress, and may have some gaps in information as we continue updating the docs in the coming weeks.

# Sails version changelog


## Beta

### 0.8.79
+ Merged waterline into main Sails repo.
+ Brought in sails-util and sails-moduleloader, moved watelrine tests into top level.
+ Attribute values in models in result sets from Waterline are now cast to numbers, if they are number-looking strings.
+ Substantial refactoring of waterline model-augmentation logic.
+ Added TODO for asynchronous module loading for future.
+ Upgraded waterline-dirty dep.


### 0.8.77
+ Patch updates the waterline-dirty dependency to deal with an issue with that adapter returning objects which map directly to the in-memory database (was causing changes made to found models to be persisted without calling .save())

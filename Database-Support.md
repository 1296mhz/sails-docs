The Sails community supports the following databases out of the box:

# Supported Adapters:
* mySQL
  * sails-mysql in npm
* DirtyDB (for development only)
  * sails-dirty in npm
* MongoDB
  * sails-mongo in npm
* Redis (still in testing) 
  * sails-redis in npm

# Roadmap
* SQLite
* PostgreSQL


If the database you need isn't listed above, you can help contribute to an existing project or create your own.  Also, adapters are not limited to databases.  Web services like LDAP, Active Directory, and even things like Twitter and Facebook can be accessed via the ORM through adapters.
